C#

>Write a simple program that lets the user manage a list of elements. It can be a grocery list, "to do" list, etc. Refer to Looping Based on a Logical Expression if necessary to see how to implement an infinite loop. Each time through the loop, ask the user to perform an operation, and then show the current contents of their list. The operations available should be Add, Remove, and Clear. The syntax should be as follows:

<code>
+ some item
- some item
--
<code>

 Use what you've learned about methods to break up that program into several methods, each responsible for a different part of the program. You might create methods to determine the action to take based on the user's input, and to perform each action. Don't worry if your methods are very short (even one line) - the point is for you to get comfortable taking code from one long method and moving it into smaller methods, while still keeping your code working.
